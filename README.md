Hi there ðŸ‘‹,

I am proactive and self disciplined.

For the last 7 years I have dedicated my time in specializaing on employment law and advising local and foreign companies on such matters. This helped me further develop these qualities as well as aquiring new ones, such as an advance level of english, a client-oriented mindset, and the ability to solve problems, transmit knowledge and the ability to work cooperatively with others.

I decided to redirect all my efforts and skills to programming, which is my new found passion. Currently, I managed to overcome my first obstacle, concluding Soy Henry Web Developer Bootcamp. This helped me aquire the following tools which will help me to continue on with my studies: 

JavaScript | NodeJs | Express | SQL | MongoDB | React | Redux | Firebase | HTML5 | CSS3 | Chakra UI | SCRUM | GIT | Heroku | Vercel | Railway.

Now looking for a job where I can add value and continue my career path. Do not hesitate to contact me through the following ðŸ“«:
